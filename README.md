# Dagoy - Content Sharing Platform

Dagoy is a content platform for users to share their content. The concept is that you cannot follow any users, to keep content democracy on a high level and nobody gets to ride on the "high follower number bluff = quality".. What you can do on Dagoy is bookmark posts, filter them by category and also like posts if you appreciate a users content. 

Each user has access to their own profile once they are signed in where they can create posts, see all their bookmarks, edit their profile image and password.

If anyone needs to get in touch with the admin, they can fill out the contact form and the Admin will haveget in touch as soon as possible.

# User Experience
- This content application was built for my Portfolio Project 5 as part of my Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development, Code Institute. 

## Site goal
- The goal of this project is to demonstrate expereience and skills learned throughout the course as a final project within HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and Django REST Framework.

- The application is a content sharing app where users can sign up, inspire eachother with content and upload by category for users to filter their field of interest. 

### User Stories
- The base of this project has consisted of building user stories and plan the project from these.

### Agile Methodology

- For this project I used GitHubs own KanBan alike agile project method, where I stored my User Stories and could move them from Todo -> In Progress -> Done. This has helped me to know what was next on my list but also keep track of the projects status in terms of where I am.
