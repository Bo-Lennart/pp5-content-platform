# Dagoy - Content Sharing Platform

Dagoy is a content platform for users to share their content. The concept is that you cannot follow any users, to keep content democracy on a high level and nobody gets to ride on the "high follower number bluff = quality".. What you can do on Dagoy is bookmark posts, filter them by category and also like posts if you appreciate a users content. 

Each user has access to their own profile once they are signed in where they can create posts, see all their bookmarks, edit their profile image and password.

If anyone needs to get in touch with the admin, they can fill out the contact form and the Admin will haveget in touch as soon as possible.

# User Experience
- This content application was built for my Portfolio Project 5 as part of my Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development, Code Institute. 

## Site goal
- The goal of this project is to demonstrate expereience and skills learned throughout the course as a final project within HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and Django REST Framework.

- The application is a content sharing app where users can sign up, inspire eachother with content and upload by category for users to filter their field of interest. 

### User Stories
- The base of this project has consisted of building user stories and plan the project from these.

    1. USER STORY:  As a user I have a navbar to every page so I can navigate easely
    2. USER STORY:  As a user I can sign up for the news page in order to access the features of a signed up user
    3. USER STORY:  As a user I can sign in to the app and access functionality for users
    4. USER STORY:  As a user I can tell if I'm logged in or not so I can log in if I need to
    5. USER STORY:  (Refreshin access tokens) as a user I can maintain my logged in status until I choose to log out so that my experience is not compromised

    13. USER STORY:  As a user I can edit my own post title, description or category so I can make corrections or updates after they've been created
    14. USER STORY: As a user I can fill out a form to contact Admin and make them aware of issues, feedback or any other matter of contact. 
    15. USER STORY:  As a user I can change my profile picture and change password
    16. USER STORY:  As a user I can update my account password so I can keep my profile secure


### Agile Methodology

- For this project I used GitHubs own KanBan alike agile project method, where I stored my User Stories and could move them from Todo -> In Progress -> Done. This has helped me to know what was next on my list but also keep track of the projects status in terms of where I am.
